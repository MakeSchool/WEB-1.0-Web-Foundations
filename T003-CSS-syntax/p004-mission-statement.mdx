# Personal Mission Statement

In this project, you'll write your mission statement and code a page from scratch using HTML and
CSS.

## Mise en place

Before you start coding your site, you'll need to decide what you want to show on your page.

- Write your mission statement on paper or in a separate doc.
- Decide what else you want to show on the page. Your name? Links? A longer description? Your
  background story? Your values or style? Photos? Get those materials together before you get
  started coding.
- As much as possible, make your other design decisions (font, colors, spacing)

## Instructions

After you've gathered your ingredients, fork the starter repo.

Add your mission statement and other content to your page, using HTML elements. You'll probably use
headings, paragraphs, lists, and anchor tags, depending on what content you've chosen.

Once the content is in place, add styles. You should try to style at least two different selectors,
and four different properties, though feel free to style more than that.

## Examples

Here's some example mission statement pages from other MakeSchool staff and students.

## Design tips

- Simple is good.
- Borrow inspiration from sites you think are cool.
- Make text readable. That means large-enough font sizes and text color that has enough contrast
  with the background color. (Don't put yellow text on a white background, or maroon text on a black
  background)

## CSS tips to make your page look 'simpler'

Some sites look complicated because they're missing one or two easy fixes.

- Text should have a max width
- Leave a margin on the left and right
- Use only one or two fonts (family + size combinations)
- Put things in the center, or on the left
- Add line spacing

Other tricks that are sometimes nice:

- `list-style: none` makes the dots next to the list items not show up
- `text-align` right, left, or center

## Choosing fonts

Fonts are hard. There's a lot of them, and choosing the combination that fits is hard. On top of
that, not every font is available on everyone's browser, so you have to include some custom fonts on
your site for them to work.

It's easy to sink a lot of time into messing with fonts, so be careful.

One option is to skip choosing fonts, and use the defaults. That's okay - here's what the default
fonts look like for the demo site: TODO

If you want to choose fonts, but don't want to do lots of configuration, you can use _web safe
fonts_ - ones that are installed on most computers. https://www.cssfontstack.com/ lists fonts that
you can use without any configuration. You can use the `font-family` property with any of these
fonts without any more setup.

If you want even more font choices, and are willing to do the configuration, you can use
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). When you've chosen fonts you have two steps to do: copy
and paste the `<link>` into your html to include the font, then add the CSS rule to apply that font
to some elements.

Other tools that could come in handy:

- https://www.fontpair.co/fonts has a list of pairs of popular fonts
- https://fontjoy.com/ lets you generate font combinations that match each other.
