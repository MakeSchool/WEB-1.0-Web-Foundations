# CSS Selectors

In each of the exercises, the first step was to write the CSS to select which elements to style.

So far, we've only selected elements based on the _tag_, like `h1` or `p`. That's pretty useful!
But, there's lots of times when you might want to apply a property to only _some_ of the `p` tags,
but not all of them. You can use other kinds of CSS selectors in those situations.

## Type Selector

This is the main kind of selector you've been using so far. The type of HTML element you're styling
is the selector.

To select the `h1` elements, use the selector `h1`, like

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What selector would you use to style all the paragraph elements?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Since the HTML tag is `p`, the CSS selector is `p`, like

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Class Selector and Id Selector

`class` and `id` are HTML attributes you can add to any element. They act as a target for you to
pick them with a CSS selector.

```html
<p class="description">
  This tender treat is a perfect use for any old bananas you have sitting on the counter.
</p>
```

This paragraph could be targeted with the selector `.description`.

```css
.description {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

Class selectors are written with a dot `.` and the name of the class. So, `.description` selects all
the elements that have the attribute `class="description"`.

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

How would you select all the elements with `class="ingredient"`?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`.ingredient`

In a complete CSS rule, it would look like

```css
.ingredient {
  color: black;
}
```

</Answer>
</FlashCard>

`id` is an attribute like `class`, but it's only supposed to be used on a single element.

If you have the HTML

```html
<img id="hero-image" src="banana-bread.jpeg" />
```

The `id` selector uses the `#` character (pronounced 'hash' or 'pound'), then the id value, so
`#hero-image`.

```css
#hero-image {
  width: 400px;
  height: 600px;
}
```

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What CSS selector would you use to select the second list item?

```html
<ol>
  <li id="prep">10 minutes prep time</li>
  <li id="bake">50 minutes bake time</li>
</ol>
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The second list item has the id `"bake"`, so the CSS selector would be `#bake`.

```css
#bake {
  color: coral;
}
```

</Answer>
</FlashCard>

## Combining Selectors

With Class and Id selectors, we can select any HTML elements on our page. Add a class or id to the
HTML elements, then write the selector. That strategy works, but it means that we have to change the
HTML in order to paint the right target for the CSS.

By combining selectors, we can write more powerful selectors, that require fewer changes to our
HTML.

### Put them together

You can combine selectors together to select elements that match all the parts. To select all the
paragraphs with `class="description"`

```
p.description
```

You combine the `p` selector with the `.description` selector by joining them together.

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

How would you select a `h3` element with the id `"subheader"`?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Join the `h3` and `#subheader` selectors.

`h3#subheader`

In a full rule,

```css
h3#subheader {
  font-family: Garamond;
}
```

</Answer>
</FlashCard>

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

How would you select the elements with class `"ingredient"` and class `"optional"`?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

The two class selectors would be `.ingredient` and `.optional`. You can join them together without a
space to select elements that have both classes.

`.ingredient.optional`

In a full rule,

```css
.ingredient.optional {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

</Answer>
</FlashCard>

### Descendant Selector

If you put a space between two selectors, CSS selects the elements inside the first selector that
also match the second selector.

For instance, `ol li` matches list elements inside an ordered list.

```css
ol li {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

What elements would the selector `.description a` match?

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`.description a` matches anchor elements inside an element with the class `"description"`.

Here's some HTML showing matching and non-matching elements:

```
<p class="description">
  <a href="">This anchor element matches</a>
  <span>
    <a href="">And this anchor element matches</a>
    This text does not match
  </span>
</p>
<a href="">Outside of the 'p', so not a match</a>
```

</Answer>
</FlashCard>

### Child Selector

If you want to select HTML elements that are the direct children of another selected element, you
can use the child selector `>`.

Here's an HTML snippet:

```html
<p>
  <a href="recipes.com">More Recipes</a>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="">Cheeseburger Soup</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Chicken Fajitas</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Okonomiyaki (Cabbage Pancakes)</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>
```

Using the child selector `p > a`, we can select the anchor element
`<a href="recipes.com">More Recipes</a>`, but not the other links.

The child selector selects only the direct children - not elements further inside.

The descendant selector `p a` would select all the anchors - "More Recipes", "Cheeseburger Soup",
"Chicken Fajitas", and "Okonomiyaki (Cabbage Pancakes)".

<FlashCard>
<Prompt>

Given the following HTML, how would you select only the outer list items (not the inner ones for the
Sauce list)

```html
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Chicken thighs</li>
  <li>Green onions</li>
  <li>
    Sauce:
    <ul>
      <li>Honey</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
```

</Prompt>
<Answer>

`.ingredients > li`

If you use `ul li`, or `.ingredients li`, the descendant selector will select all the list
elements - even the ones for the sauce.

If you use `ul > li`, the Sauce list elements will be selected too - they are direct descendants of
a matching `ul`, even if it's not the one you meant.

### What happens when there is more than one selector that matches?

For example:

```html
<p class="description">
  "Wow" is sure to be the unanimous response from guests after their first bite of this moist herb
  chicken with garlic sauce.
</p>
```

```css
.description {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

Both the selectors `p` and `.description` will match the paragraph. So, which color will the
paragraph be?

In this case, it'll be blue - `.description` has a higher _specificity_ than `p`, so it gets picked.

If both rules were the same, the last one 'wins':

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The last one wins, so the color would be `red`.

The rules the browser follows for choosing which selector 'wins' are a little complicated. You can
read more about them in the
[MDN Documentation for CSS Cascade and Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).
