# CSS Selectors

In each of the exercises, the first step was to write the CSS to select which elements to style.

So far, we've only selected elements based on the _tag_, like `h1` or `p`. That's pretty useful!
But, there's lots of times when you might want to apply a property to only _some_ of the `p` tags,
but not all of them. You can use other kinds of CSS selectors in those situations.

A lot of staff and students have enjoyed practicing CSS selectors with
[CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). For each prompt, you have to figure out the right CSS
selector to use.
