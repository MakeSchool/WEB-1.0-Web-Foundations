# Intro To Javascript

HTML is for content. CSS is for styles. JavaScript is for _action_.

JavaScript lets you write a set of actions for the browser to take. You can think of JavaScript code
as the "script" that the browser will perform, step by step.

In a stage play, a script has lines for the characters to say and directions for them to act out.

In JavaScript, you write out the instructions for what should happen to the content on the page, and
when.

JavaScript's syntax is more complex than HTML or CSS, and people usually run into more bugs and
errors. Those errors and bugs can be confusing, and it can be frustrating when you're not sure how
to do something with code that you think should be possible.

We encourage you to ask for help when you run into problems or questions.

## JavaScript Game Plan

There are different ways to approach JavaScript. If you've done some programming before, or feel
comfortable seeing the syntax with less context, you can <>Go to the Syntax</>.

If you'd rather see some examples of JavaScript code in action, and then learn what each part is
doing, you can <>Explore the examples</>. The examples will give you a more specific idea of what
javascript can do.

After the syntax and examples, you'll practice what you've learned with small exercises. We'll
combine the small exercises into larger challenges integrating different concepts. Then we'll give
scoped, bounded projects where you can use your new skills in creative ways. That cycle will repeat
for a few different concepts.
