# JavaScript Problem Solving and Debugging

## Where can we run JavaScript?

### The Developer Console

If you're using a computer with a keyboard, you can use the keyboard shortcut Shift + âŒ˜ + J (on
macOS) or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) to open the console.

You can copy and paste snippets of JavaScript into the console and press Return or Enter to run
them.

Practice now with the first example:

```js
alert('Hi there');
```

This will show an alert with the message `Hi there`.

### Replit

When there's an embedded Repl, you can run the code by clicking the green play button.

### Code Demos

Many examples run the code in an iframe.

## Goal-driven JavaScript

Problem solving in JavaScript often starts from a goal.

- "I want to show the answer when the button is clicked"
- "I want to greet the user by name when they type their name"
- "I want to show an error message if the number is too low or too high"
- "I want to send the user's input to the server when they click 'Submit'"
- "I want to hide each element on the page if it's an ad"

The goal may come from an exercise in this course, from the constraints of a project you're working
on, or from a design you think of yourself. Wherever the goal comes from, solving it involves:

- Breaking down the problem into pieces
- Figuring out the code tools to solve each piece
- Writing and debugging the code

The more tools you have in your JavaScript toolbelt, and the more familiar you are with those tools,
the better you'll be at breaking down the problems and applying the tools to solve them.
