# JavaScript Syntax

This is an intro to the basic concepts and syntax of JavaScript.

This page is information-dense. It might be best to scan through it, look at examples and exercises,
then come back to it when you run into a question.

There's lots of links to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About) for
further reading. They're a trusted source of documentation and reference materials for web
technologies.

## Code Comments

It's often helpful for developers to leave notes in the code. Comments are a way to write text that
_does nothing_.

This is a single-line comment.

```js
// everything on this line after the two forward slashes is ignored
```

This is a multi-line comment, between the `/*` and the `*/`.

```js
/*  anything between the slash+star and the star+slash  is ignored */

/*

It can go for multiple lines
like this
and JavaScript will ignore it!

*/
```

We'll use comments in the course to explain pieces of code.

## Representing Data

The first building block of JavaScript is _data_. Data is the _stuff_ in your program, the nouns,
the things that you act on.

There are nine types of data in JavaScript.

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- BigInt
- Symbol
- Object
- Function

Apart from mentioning them now, this course will ignore `BigInt` and `Symbol` types. We'll also
leave Object and Function types for later on, so first lets focus on the basic 'primitive types'.

### Number

Numbers can go right into code.

```
3
10
-43
90000
6.832
```

Sometimes, you have to be careful about fractional numbers, because they don't always work how you
expect them to.

<Info>

In some other programming languages, there are different types of numbers (often one or more integer
and floating point types). Historically, JavaScript has only had one type of number, which uses a
double-precision floating point representation. (As of 2019-2020, there's also BigInt, for correctly
operating on large integers). If you've used a language with integer and floating point types,
JavaScript just has floats.

</Info>

### String

Programs need a way to distinguish between the program code and text that the program manipulates.

In the examples, you see code like:

```js
alert('Hello, world!');
```

`Hello, world!` is the message that shows in the alert.

In JavaScript, text is represented as a String. You can type a string into your program by
surrounding the text with quotes:

```js
"This is a string."
'It's text - JavaScript won't try to run it as code.'
"You can use single or double quotes, so long as they match at the start and end."
"If you want a quote mark in your string, you'll need to use the other kind on the outside"
`You can also use backticks! They work a little differently, as we'll see later.`
```

### Boolean

```
true
false
```

`true` and `false` are the two Boolean values in JavaScript.

Programs often need to decide what to do based on some condition. `true` and `false` are the way a
program can keep track of what it needs to make decisions.

We'll learn more about logic, conditionals, and `if` statements later on. That's when we'll see how
to use `true` and `false` values to make decisions in programs.

### Undefined and Null

Programs sometimes need a way to say "there's nothing here". JavaScript has two ways to represent
something that doesn't exist.

`undefined` is the default value that JavaScript uses when a value hasn't been set.

`null` is usually the value that programmers use to represent 'empty' or 'nothing'.

These tend to be less useful than other values, but you'll see them show up in lots of places, so it
helps to be able to recognize them.

## Operators, expressions, and statements

Data and variables are way more useful if we can do things with them.

**Operators** let us do things with data.

### Arithmetic Operators

Some of the simplest operators are the Arithmetic operators. They let us do basic math with numbers.

```
5 + 10
6 * 6
12 - 2
100 / 10
```

- `+` for addition
- `*` for multiplication
- `-` for subtraction
- `/` for division

Try evaluating each of these to check that they work like they do in math class.

There's two other math arithmetic operators, `**` for exponentiation and `%` for modulo.

They might be less familiar, but they come in handy.

`**` is exponentiation, which raises a number to a power.

```
// 2 raised to the power of 3, equals (2 * 2 * 2), equals 8
2 ** 3 // 8

// 10 raised to the power of 5, (10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10), 100000
10 ** 5 // 10000
```

`%` is modulo, which calculates the remainder.

```
10 % 5 // 0
11 % 5 // 1
12 % 5 // 2
13 % 5 // 3
14 % 5 // 4
15 % 5 // 0
16 % 5 // 1
```

It's the leftover part after dividing evenly.

```
16 % 2 // 0
17 % 2 // 1
18 % 2 // 0
```

<FlashCard prompt="What is the result of (12 % 10) ?" answer="2" />

### String operators

The `+` operator doesn't just work on numbers - it also joins strings together.

```
"Hello " + "world" // "Hello world"
```

You have to be careful about spaces. `+` won't add any extra spaces to your strings, so you can end
up with a surprising result.

```
"Hello" + "world" // "Helloworld"
```

### Grouping and evaluation order

It's often useful to group parts of an expression together.

```js
(5 + 4) * 10; // 90
```

Parentheses `(` and `)` make a group into a unit that stands on its own.

Without the parentheses, that code would have a different result.

```js
5 + 4 * 10; // 45
```

That means that JavaScript is evaluating the `*` before the `+`. JavaScript has rules for deciding
which operators happen first. You don't need to memorize those rules. If you are confused about the
order things are happening, you can use parens `()` to group parts of the expression to see what
changes, or refer to the
[MDN documentation on Operator Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

JavaScript also has other operators that we didn't cover here. The
[MDN Operator Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)
has a list of all the operators and their descriptions.

## Variables

Variables are containers for data.

```js
let message = 'Hi there, how are you?';
```

You can think of a variable as a label, a nametag, or a box. They hold onto the value, so the
program can use it later.

To use the value, you use the name of the variable:

```js
let message = 'Hi there, how are you?';
alert(message);
console.log(message);
alert(message);
```

Variables can hold one value of any data type.

```js
let powerLevel = 11;
let lovesJavaScript = true;
let nothing = null;
```

Let's look at the syntax for creating a variable more closely:

```
let powerLevel = 11
```

- It starts with the `let` keyword
- Then the name of the variable
- Then `=`
- Finally, the value to assign

If, later on, we want to change the value in the box, we can reassign the variable.

```
powerLevel = 12
```

We leave off the `let` keyword when we reassign an existing variable.

To use the value of the variable, we use its name.

```
powerLevel
```

We can use a variable anywhere we would use another value. For example, in an expression:

```
let powerLevel = 12
powerLevel * 10 // 120
powerLevel + 6 // 18
```

Using the variable doesn't change its value, but we can change the value with reassignment.

```
let powerLevel = 10
console.log(powerLevel)

powerLevel = powerLevel + 1
console.log(powerLevel)

powerLevel = powerLevel + 2
console.log(powerLevel)
```

<Info>

There's actually three different keywords for creating a variable in JavaScript: `var`, `let`, and
`const`. They have slightly different rules for _scope_, which decides which names are defined at
different points in a program.

You may see all three keywords.

- `const` variables can't be reassigned. This is helpful for things that you don't want to
  accidentally change later in the program.
- `let` and `var` are similar, but have some key differences, especially _hoisting_ and _block
  scope_.

For now, you can just use `let` and ignore the differences. After you've written plenty of programs
using variables and functions, you should learn about scope and the differences between these
keywords.

</Info>

## Calling functions

Operators aren't the only thing that let us do stuff with data. _Functions_ can do more things with
data, like show an message with `alert` or `console.log`, or get input from the user with `prompt`.

Let's look at some of the built-in functions first, so you can see how to use functions. Later on,
you'll see how to make your own functions that do what you want.

### alert

`alert` is a function that shows a message to a user.

You use alert like this:

```js
alert('This is the message');
```

You _pass in_ a string value to the function `alert`, inside the parentheses.

```js
let message = 'This string will be kept in a variable';
alert(message);
```

### Function call syntax

That's the pattern for using any function. You use the function's name (like `alert`) then
parentheses, with whatever data the function needs.

```js
name(data);
```

Some functions don't need any data. We can use empty parentheses in that case:

```js
noDataNeeded();
```

Other functions need more data. For example, a function `add` that adds two numbers would need both
numbers.

```js
add(5, 10);
```

As you can see, we separate the two pieces of data with a comma: `,`.

Some function vocabulary:

- the data we pass to a function is called the _arguments_
- we call using a function "running", "invoking", or "calling" the function

### console.log

The alert box is sometimes annoying to users. Developers use the `console.log` function to show a
message in the _Developer Console_, where it's less obtrusive.

```js
console.log('This log message only shows in the developer console');
```

Like `alert`, it takes in a message argument, so that it knows what to display.

### prompt and confirm

`prompt` is a function that shows a message and gets input from the user:

```js
prompt("What's your name?");
```

`prompt` returns what the user types in as a string. If you want to use that string later, you can
store it as a variable:

```js
let response = prompt("What's your name?");
alert('Nice to meet you, ' + response);
```

`confirm` is like prompt, only instead of a text box, it shows buttons for 'Ok' and 'Cancel'.

```js
confirm('Really delete the message?');
```

It also takes in a string as arguments. Instead of returning a string, it returns a boolean: `true`
if the user clicked "Ok", and `false` if the user clicked `Cancel`.

```js
let shouldDelete = confirm('Really delete?');
alert('You answered: ' + shouldDelete);
```

`prompt` and `confirm` are functions that give back a value. The data you get from calling a
function is called a _return value_. Later on, you'll use the `return` keyword to write a function
that gives back a value.

The vocab to know is that when a function 'sends back' a value, we say it _returns_ the value.
`prompt` is a function that returns a string and `confirm` is a function that returns a boolean.

### typeof

If you have a piece of data, and you want to know what datatype it is, you can use `typeof`.

`typeof` returns a string with the name of the type of data.

```
typeof(100) // 'number'
typeof("Hello") // 'string'
typeof(true) // 'boolean'
typeof(undefined) // 'undefined'
typeof(alert) // 'function'
```

<Info>

There's a weird gotcha.

```
typeof(null) // 'object'
```

JavaScript isn't perfect. The language maintainers discussed fixing this, but it turns out that
there's some real-world code that would break if `typeof(null)` were fixed to return `'null'`.

</Info>

<Info>

`typeof` is technically an operator, not a function. It works whether or not you use parentheses.

```
typeof 7 // 'number'
```

You don't need to know this, but you might see it in examples online.

</Info>

### Converting between datatypes

Sometimes we have a string, but want a number, or the other way around.

```js
let response = prompt('How many one-dollar books would you like to order?');
let cost = response + 15;
alert(cost + ' dollars with shipping.');
```

If you entered 10, you would expect the alert message to be `25 dollars with shipping`. Because the
response is a String, the alert message will instead be `1015 dollars with shipping`.

You need to turn the String `"10"` into a Number. To do that, you can use `parseInt`. 'Parse' means
'take apart' or 'analyze'. In this case, `parseInt` means 'turn this string into a number'.

```js
let response = prompt('How many one-dollar books would you like to order?');
let booksCount = parseInt(response);
let cost = booksCount + 15;
alert(cost + ' dollars with shipping.');
```

Now the correct message will display.

`parseInt` is a function that takes a string argument and returns a number.

In case there's a fractional number, like `"12.8"`, you can use `parseFloat`.

```js
let response = prompt('How many miles are you traveling?');
let miles = parseFloat(response);
let km = miles * 2.45;
alert("That's " + km + ' kilometers!');
```

To go the other direction, you can use `toString`. It's a little different - you put it on the end
of the number with a dot, like:

```js
let miles = 152;
console.log(miles.toString());
```

JavaScript will automatically convert numbers to strings when you try to add a number to a string
with `+`, or if you use `console.log`, so `toString` won't be as useful for now.

## Conditions and if statements

Programs do different things based on conditions. JavaScript has a few ways to control the flow of
the program.

`if` statements check if a condition is true, then run some code if it is.

```js
let response = prompt('Should we go ahead?');
if (response === 'yes') {
  alert("Let's go!");
}
```

The `alert` will only happen if the user typed in "yes" at the prompt.

Let's break down this snippet. First, we're storing the reponse from `prompt` in a variable.

```js
let response = prompt('Should we go ahead?');
```

The next line has two new tools: the `if` statement, and the `===` operator.

The equality operator `===` checks if two values are the same. If they are, the result is `true`. If
not, the result is `false`. We can check it on its own:

The `if` statement has this form:

```
if ( condition to check ) {
  code to run if condition is true
}
```

### Comparison operators

Let's look at `===` more closely.

```
10 === 10 // true
"fish" === "fish" // true
5 === 10 // false
"dog" === "fish" // false
```

It works with variables too:

```
let name = "Ahmed"
name === "Ahmed" // true
"Mariam" === name // false
```

<Info>

It's sometimes easy to mix up `=` and `===`. `=` is for _assignment, it stores a value in a
variable. `===` is for \_comparison_, and it's for checking equality.

There's also `==`. It's a comparison operator like `===`, but it does type conversion first, which
can be confusing.

```js
7 === '7'; // false
7 == '7'; // true
```

It's normally recommended to use `===` for equality checking.

</Info>

There's other comparison operators like `===`. Depending on the condition you want to express, they
can each be useful.

- `!==` is the 'not equals' operator. It gives the opposite result as `===`.
- `>` is the 'greater than' operator.
- `<` is the 'less than' operator.
- `>=` is 'greater than or equal'
- `<=` is 'less than or equal'

[Comparison Operators on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)

### Aside: Semicolons

Js uses semicolons to end a statement.

```js
var x = 10;
```

The `;` means the statement is done.

Since people sometimes forget the semicolons, JavaScript will automatically add them at the end of
each line when it runs the code.

So, this is allowed:

```
var x = 10
alert(x * 10)
```

and it turns into

```js
var x = 10;
alert(x * 10);
```

Some people like to write code without semicolons, some people like to write code with semicolons.

There's a couple situations where there's a difference, but usually you can choose which style you
like best.

### Potential Misconception: If vs. When

When we talk informally, sometimes we say things like "if the button is clicked, show the message".
That can lead to a misconception about how JavaScript's `if` works.

`if` is for checking whether something is true _right now_.

```js
if (age < 18) {
  alert('cannot buy movie ticket');
}
```

The code will not run again on its own if `age` changes.

To take some action when something happens, we use `addEventListener` to set up our response to the
_event_. Run this code _when_ the event happens.
