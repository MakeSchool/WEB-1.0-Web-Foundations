# JavaScript Syntax

This is an intro to the basic concepts and syntax of JavaScript.

This page is information-dense. It might be best to scan through it, look at examples and exercises,
then come back to it when you run into a question.

## Code Comments

It's often helpful for developers to leave notes in the code. Comments are a way to write text that
_does nothing_.

This is a single-line comment.

```js
// everything on this line after the two forward slashes is ignored
```

This is a multi-line comment, between the `/*` and the `*/`.

```js
/*  anything between the slash+star and the star+slash  is ignored */

/*

It can go for multiple lines
like this
and JavaScript will ignore it!

*/
```

We'll use comments in the course to explain pieces of code.

## Representing Data

The first building block of JavaScript is _data_. Data is the _stuff_ in your program, the nouns,
the things that you act on.

There are nine types of data in JavaScript.

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- BigInt
- Symbol
- Object
- Function

Apart from mentioning them now, we're going to totally ignore `BigInt` and `Symbol` types in this
course. We'll also leave Object and Function types for later on, so first lets focus on the basic
'primitive types'.

### Number

### String

### Boolean

### Undefined and Null

## Variables

Variables are containers for data.

The syntax looks like:

```js

```

You can think of a variable as a label, a nametag, or a box.

## Operators

And statements

### Calling functions

### console.log

### alert

### prompt

### typeof

### Converting between datatypes

parseInt parseFloat toString

## Conditions and if statements

## Objects

### Accessing properties

## Functions

### Writing functions

### Callbacks

## Looping

## Arrays

Aside: 'literal' syntaxes

### Helpful functions and properties we've seen

- querySelector
- innerHTML
- setTimeout
- querySelectorAll
- addEventListener
- Math.random

## Recommended Resources

- MDN for comprehensive documentation

## Things we have not covered

- Promises and Async
- execution context, scope, and globals
- destructuring assignment
- arrow functions
- hoisting
- regular expressions
- template literals
- special characters and escaping
- switch
- break and continue
- for, while, for in, for of
- errors, throw, try, catch, finally
- class, new

### Potential Misconception: If vs. When

When we talk informally, sometimes we say things like "if the button is clicked, show the message".
That can lead to a misconception about how JavaScript's `if` works.

`if` is for checking whether something is true _right now_.

```js
if (age < 18) {
  alert('cannot buy movie ticket');
}
```

The code will not run again on its own if `age` changes.

To take some action when something happens, we use `addEventListener` to set up our response to the
_event_. Run this code _when_ the event happens.
