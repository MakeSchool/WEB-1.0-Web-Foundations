# JavaScript Syntax

This is an intro to the basic concepts and syntax of JavaScript.

This page is information-dense. It might be best to scan through it, look at examples and exercises,
then come back to it when you run into a question.

There's lots of links to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About) for
further reading. They're a trusted source of documentation and reference materials for web
technologies.

## Code Comments

It's often helpful for developers to leave notes in the code. Comments are a way to write text that
_does nothing_.

This is a single-line comment.

```js
// everything on this line after the two forward slashes is ignored
```

This is a multi-line comment, between the `/*` and the `*/`.

```js
/*  anything between the slash+star and the star+slash  is ignored */

/*

It can go for multiple lines
like this
and JavaScript will ignore it!

*/
```

We'll use comments in the course to explain pieces of code.

## Representing Data

The first building block of JavaScript is _data_. Data is the _stuff_ in your program, the nouns,
the things that you act on.

There are nine types of data in JavaScript.

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- BigInt
- Symbol
- Object
- Function

Apart from mentioning them now, this course will ignore `BigInt` and `Symbol` types. We'll also
leave Object and Function types for later on, so first let's focus on the five 'primitive types'.

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null

### Number

Numbers can go right into code.

```
3
10
-43
90000
6.832
```

Sometimes, you have to be careful about fractional numbers, because they don't always work how you
expect them to.

<Info>

In some other programming languages, there are different types of numbers (often one or more integer
and floating point types). Historically, JavaScript has only had one type of number, which uses a
double-precision floating point representation. (As of 2019-2020, there's also BigInt, for correctly
operating on large integers). If you've used a language with integer and floating point types,
JavaScript just has floats.

Read more about the
[JavaScript Number type on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)

</Info>

### String

Programs need a way to distinguish between the program code and text that the program manipulates.

In the examples, you see code like:

```js
alert('Hello, world!');
```

`alert` is code. `Hello, world!` is the message that shows in the alert.

In JavaScript, text is represented as a _string_. You can type a string into your program by
surrounding the text with quotes:

```js
"This is a string."
'It's text - JavaScript won't try to run it as code.'
"You can use single or double quotes, so long as they match at the start and end."
"If you want a quote mark in your string, you'll need to use the other kind on the outside"
`You can also use backticks! They work a little differently, as you'll see later.`
```

The name "string" comes from 'a string of characters', since in the computer, the text is
represented as one character after another.

### Boolean

```
true
false
```

`true` and `false` are the two Boolean values in JavaScript.

Programs often need to decide what to do based on some condition. `true` and `false` are the way a
program can keep track of what it needs to make decisions.

You'll learn more about logic, conditionals, and `if` statements later on. That's when you'll see
how to use `true` and `false` values to make decisions in programs.

### Undefined and Null

Programs sometimes need a way to say "there's nothing here". JavaScript has two ways to represent
something that doesn't exist.

`undefined` is the default value that JavaScript uses when a value hasn't been set.

`null` is usually the value that programmers use to represent 'empty' or 'nothing'.

These tend to be less useful than other values, but you'll see them show up in lots of places, so it
helps to be able to recognize them.

## Operators, expressions, and statements

Data and variables are way more useful if you can do things with them.

**Operators** let us do things with data.

### Arithmetic Operators

Some of the simplest operators are the Arithmetic operators. They let us do basic math with numbers.

```
5 + 10
6 * 6
12 - 2
100 / 10
```

- `+` for addition
- `*` for multiplication
- `-` for subtraction
- `/` for division

Try evaluating each of these to check that they work like they do in math class.

There's two other math arithmetic operators, `**` for exponentiation and `%` for modulo.

They might be less familiar, but they come in handy.

`**` is exponentiation, which raises a number to a power.

```
// 2 raised to the power of 3, equals (2 * 2 * 2), equals 8
2 ** 3 // 8

// 10 raised to the power of 5, (10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10), 100000
10 ** 5 // 10000
```

`%` is modulo, which calculates the remainder.

```
10 % 5 // 0
11 % 5 // 1
12 % 5 // 2
13 % 5 // 3
14 % 5 // 4
15 % 5 // 0
16 % 5 // 1
```

It's the leftover part after dividing evenly.

```
16 % 2 // 0
17 % 2 // 1
18 % 2 // 0
```

<FlashCard prompt="What is the result of (12 % 10) ?" answer="2" />

### String operators

The `+` operator doesn't just work on numbers - it also joins strings together.

```
"Hello " + "world" // "Hello world"
```

You have to be careful about spaces. `+` won't add any extra spaces to your strings, so you can end
up with a surprising result.

```
"Hello" + "world" // "Helloworld"
```

### Grouping and evaluation order

It's often useful to group parts of an expression together.

```js
(5 + 4) * 10; // 90
```

Parentheses `(` and `)` make a group into a unit that stands on its own.

Without the parentheses, that code would have a different result.

```js
5 + 4 * 10; // 45
```

That means that JavaScript is evaluating the `*` before the `+`. JavaScript has rules for deciding
which operators happen first. You don't need to memorize those rules. If you are confused about the
order things are happening, you can use parens `()` to group parts of the expression to see what
changes, or refer to the
[MDN documentation on Operator Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

JavaScript also has other operators that we didn't cover here. The
[MDN Operator Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)
has a list of all the operators and their descriptions.

## Variables

Variables are containers for data.

```js
let message = 'Hi there, how are you?';
```

You can think of a variable as a label, a nametag, or a box. They hold onto the value, so the
program can use it later.

To use the value, you use the name of the variable:

```js
let message = 'Hi there, how are you?';
alert(message);
console.log(message);
alert(message);
```

Variables can hold one value of any data type.

```js
let powerLevel = 11;
let lovesJavaScript = true;
let nothing = null;
```

Let's look at the syntax for creating a variable more closely:

```
let powerLevel = 11
```

- It starts with the `let` keyword
- Then the name of the variable
- Then `=`
- Finally, the value to assign

If, later on, you want to change the value in the box, you can reassign the variable.

```
powerLevel = 12
```

You leave off the `let` keyword when you reassign an existing variable.

To use the value of the variable, you use its name.

```
powerLevel
```

You can use a variable anywhere you would use another value. For example, in an expression:

```
let powerLevel = 12
powerLevel * 10 // 120
powerLevel + 6 // 18
```

Using the variable doesn't change its value, but you can change the value with reassignment.

```
let powerLevel = 10
console.log(powerLevel)

powerLevel = powerLevel + 1
console.log(powerLevel)

powerLevel = powerLevel + 2
console.log(powerLevel)
```

<Info>

There's actually three different keywords for creating a variable in JavaScript: `var`, `let`, and
`const`. They have slightly different rules for _scope_, which decides which names are defined at
different points in a program.

You may see all three keywords.

- `const` variables can't be reassigned. This is helpful for things that you don't want to
  accidentally change later in the program.
- `let` and `var` are similar, but have some key differences, especially _hoisting_ and _block
  scope_.

For now, you can just use `let` and ignore the differences. After you've written plenty of programs
using variables and functions, you should learn about scope and the differences between these
keywords.

</Info>

## Calling functions

Operators aren't the only thing that let us do stuff with data. _Functions_ can do more things with
data, like show an message with `alert` or `console.log`, or get input from the user with `prompt`.

Let's look at some of the built-in functions first, so you can see how to use functions. Later on,
you'll see how to make your own functions that do what you want.

### alert

`alert` is a function that shows a message to a user.

You use alert like this:

```js
alert('This is the message');
```

You _pass in_ a string value to the function `alert`, inside the parentheses.

```js
let message = 'This string will be kept in a variable';
alert(message);
```

### Function call syntax

That's the pattern for using any function. You use the function's name (like `alert`) then
parentheses, with whatever data the function needs.

```js
name(data);
```

Some functions don't need any data. You can use empty parentheses in that case:

```js
noDataNeeded();
```

Other functions need more data. For example, a function `add` that adds two numbers would need both
numbers.

```js
add(5, 10);
```

As you can see, two pieces of data are separated with a comma: `,`.

Some function vocabulary:

- The data passed to a function is called the _arguments_
- We call using a function "running", "invoking", or "calling" the function

### console.log

The alert box is sometimes annoying to users. Developers use the `console.log` function to show a
message in the _Developer Console_, where it's less obtrusive.

```js
console.log('This log message only shows in the developer console');
```

Like `alert`, it takes in a message argument, so that it knows what to display.

### prompt and confirm

`prompt` is a function that shows a message and gets input from the user:

```js
prompt("What's your name?");
```

`prompt` returns what the user types in as a string. If you want to use that string later, you can
store it as a variable:

```js
let response = prompt("What's your name?");
alert('Nice to meet you, ' + response);
```

`confirm` is like prompt, only instead of a text box, it shows buttons for 'Ok' and 'Cancel'.

```js
confirm('Really delete the message?');
```

It also takes in a string as arguments. Instead of returning a string, it returns a boolean: `true`
if the user clicked "Ok", and `false` if the user clicked `Cancel`.

```js
let shouldDelete = confirm('Really delete?');
alert('You answered: ' + shouldDelete);
```

`prompt` and `confirm` are functions that give back a value. The data you get from calling a
function is called a _return value_. Later on, you'll use the `return` keyword to write a function
that gives back a value.

The vocab to know is that when a function 'sends back' a value, we say it _returns_ the value.
`prompt` is a function that returns a string and `confirm` is a function that returns a boolean.

### typeof

If you have a piece of data, and you want to know what datatype it is, you can use `typeof`.

`typeof` returns a string with the name of the type of data.

```
typeof(100) // 'number'
typeof("Hello") // 'string'
typeof(true) // 'boolean'
typeof(undefined) // 'undefined'
typeof(alert) // 'function'
```

<Info>

There's a weird gotcha.

```
typeof(null) // 'object'
```

JavaScript isn't perfect. The language maintainers discussed fixing this, but it turns out that
there's some real-world code that would break if `typeof(null)` were fixed to return `'null'`.

</Info>

<Info>

`typeof` is technically an operator, not a function. It works whether or not you use parentheses.

```
typeof 7 // 'number'
```

You don't need to know this, but you might see it in examples online.

</Info>

### Converting between datatypes

Sometimes we have a string, but want a number, or the other way around.

```js
let response = prompt('How many one-dollar books would you like to order?');
let cost = response + 15;
alert(cost + ' dollars with shipping.');
```

If you entered 10, you would expect the alert message to be `25 dollars with shipping`. Because the
response is a String, the alert message will instead be `1015 dollars with shipping`.

You need to turn the String `"10"` into a Number. To do that, you can use `parseInt`. 'Parse' means
'take apart' or 'analyze'. In this case, `parseInt` means 'turn this string into a number'.

```js
let response = prompt('How many one-dollar books would you like to order?');
let booksCount = parseInt(response);
let cost = booksCount + 15;
alert(cost + ' dollars with shipping.');
```

Now the correct message will display.

`parseInt` is a function that takes a string argument and returns a number.

In case there's a fractional number, like `"12.8"`, you can use `parseFloat`.

```js
let response = prompt('How many miles are you traveling?');
let miles = parseFloat(response);
let km = miles * 2.45;
alert("That's " + km + ' kilometers!');
```

To go the other direction, you can use `toString`. It's a little different - you put it on the end
of the number with a dot, like:

```js
let miles = 152;
console.log(miles.toString());
```

JavaScript will automatically convert numbers to strings when you try to add a number to a string
with `+`, or if you use `console.log`, so `toString` won't be as useful for now.

## Conditions and if statements

Programs do different things based on conditions. JavaScript has a few ways to control the flow of
the program.

`if` statements check if a condition is true, then run some code if it is.

```js
let response = prompt('Should we go ahead?');
if (response === 'yes') {
  alert("Let's go!");
}
```

The `alert` will only happen if the user typed in "yes" at the prompt.

Let's break down this snippet. First, we're storing the reponse from `prompt` in a variable.

```js
let response = prompt('Should we go ahead?');
```

The next line has two new tools: the `if` statement, and the `===` operator.

The equality operator `===` checks if two values are the same. If they are, the result is `true`. If
not, the result is `false`. We can check it on its own:

The `if` statement has this form:

```
if ( condition to check ) {
  code to run if condition is true
}
```

### Comparison operators

Let's look at `===` more closely.

```
10 === 10 // true
"fish" === "fish" // true
5 === 10 // false
"dog" === "fish" // false
```

It works with variables too:

```
let name = "Ahmed"
name === "Ahmed" // true
"Mariam" === name // false
```

<Info>

It's sometimes easy to mix up `=` and `===`. `=` is for _assignment, it stores a value in a
variable. `===` is for \_comparison_, and it's for checking equality.

There's also `==`. It's a comparison operator like `===`, but it does type conversion first, which
can be confusing.

```js
7 === '7'; // false
7 == '7'; // true
```

It's normally recommended to use `===` for equality checking.

</Info>

There's other comparison operators like `===`. Depending on the condition you want to express, they
can each be useful.

- `!==` is the 'not equals' operator. It gives the opposite result as `===`.
- `>` is the 'greater than' operator.
- `<` is the 'less than' operator.
- `>=` is 'greater than or equal'
- `<=` is 'less than or equal'

You can read more about the
[Comparison Operators on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)

## Objects

So far, the data types you've seen are strings, numbers, booleans (and null and undefined).

Objects are more complicated. An object bundles up data into a larger unit.

Let's look at an object:

```js
let snack = {
  name: 'crunchy carrot',
  price: 0.25,
};
```

Between the curly braces `{}`, there are pairs of _keys_ and _values_. The keys ('name' and 'price')
are names you can use to get the value from the object. The values ('crunchy carrot' and '0.25') are
data we're keeping in the object.

You use the `{` and `}` to start and end the object. There's a colon `:` between the key and value,
and there's a comma `,` after each pair of key and value.

A pair of key and value is called a _property_ of an object.

### Accessing properties

You can use a `.` to get the name or price out of the `snack` object.

```
snack.name // 'crunchy carrot'
snack.price // 0.25
```

The `.` is called a 'property accessor', because you use it to access the object's properties.

#### Bracket Notation

You can also access properties using the name, as a string, in square brackets.

```
snack['name'] // 'crunchy carrot'
snack['price'] // 0.25
```

This is a little more to type, but it can come in handy in some situations, like if you have the
name of the property as a variable.

```js
let key = prompt("Enter 'name' or 'price' to see that property");
let value = snack[key];
alert('The ' + key + ' of the snack is ' + value);
```

#### Updating properties

To set the value of a property in an object, you can an accessor and the assignment operator `=`,
like you would for a variable.

Using the dot accessor:

```js
snack.price = 0.99;
snack.rating = '⭐⭐️⭐️⭐️️';
```

Or square brackets:

```js
snack['price'] = 0.99;
snack['rating'] = '⭐⭐️⭐️⭐';
```

#### Accessing properties that don't exist

If you try to access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get `undefined`.

```
snack.color // undefined
```

JavaScript won't try to guess what the value should be, it just says "I don't know!"

### Built-in Objects

You've seen the `.` before! Every time you see `console.log` or `document.querySelector`, that's an
example of accessing an object property. In this case, `console` is an object, and you get the 'log'
property using the `.` accessor.

JavaScript in the browser has a lot of built-in functionality. Lots of the built-in functionality
uses objects. For instance, when we use `document.querySelector` to find an element on the page, we
get back an object. It's a big, complicated object, with tons of properties, but it's still just an
object.

The same is true for lots of other built-ins that the JavaScript language and the browser give you.
Big objects, with lots of properties.

## Functions

You've seen functions like `alert`, `prompt`, `console.log`, and `document.querySelector` before. To
review, calling a function looks like:

```js
nameOfFunction(arguments);
```

So, for the functions you've seen:

```js
alert('Check the developer console');
console.log("The password is 'be a good friend'");
prompt("What's the password?");
```

Now, you'll learn to write your own functions that do what you decide.

### Writing functions

Here's an example of creating a new function called `fancyLog`.

```js
function fancyLog(message) {
  console.log('>>>>>>>');
  console.log(message);
  console.log('>>>>>>>');
}
```

Let's break down the syntax:

- first is the `function` keyword
- then the name of the function
- then parentheses `()` around the function's _parameters_
- next a block of code, surrounded by curly braces `{` and `}`

Like the `if` statement, there's a block of code between `{` and `}`. This block is called the
function's _body_. It's the code that runs when we call the function.

Using the `fancyLog` function is like using `alert` or `console.log`:

```js
fancyLog('This is log is so ✨ fancy ✨');
console.log('This is log is not so fancy');
```

Let's break down what happens when you call `fancyLog`:

1. The parameter _message_ gets bound to the value of the argument `'This is log is so ✨ fancy ✨'`
2. The code in the function's body runs step by step

- first it logs `'>>>>>>>'`
- then it logs `message`, which in this case is `'This log is so ✨ fancy ✨'`
- then it logs `'>>>>>>>'` again

3. Then it comes back to where the function is called, and keeps going with the `console.log`

We can use our function as much as we like, which can save us from typing out repeated code.

```js
fancyLog('Super fancy');
fancyLog("That's how you know we're fancy developers");
fancyLog('Because our logs have sweet <<<<<');
```

## More built-in functions and properties

The browser has a lot of built-in functions and objects. Here's a short list of some of the most
useful ones when you're just getting started programming in JavaScript.

### querySelector

To do something with an element on the page, you need to get that element. `document.querySelector`
is a function that takes in a CSS selector as a string, and returns the first element that matches
the selector.

Once you have the element, you can do stuff with it, like change its contents or style, remove it,
add elements inside it, or add an event listener to it.

### querySelectorAll

`querySelector` returns only one element. If you want all the matching elements, use
`querySelectorAll`. It takes a string CSS selector, and returns all the elements that match the
selector.

### innerHTML

`innerHTML` is a property of an element. a string of HTML representing the contents inside an
element.

### innerText

`innerText` is similar to `innerHTML`, but it skips the HTML elements and only returns the text.

### Math.random

The global `Math` object has a bunch of useful math functions. `random` returns a random number
between 0 and 1. It gives a different result each time you run it.

It's useful if you want to write a program that does different when run, but isn't based on user
input.

### addEventListener

If you want to respond to an event in the browser, you can add an _event listener_ with code to run
when the event happens.

You add an event listener to a particular element, to listen for that event on that element.

Here's an example:

```html
<button>Click to alert!</button>
```

```js
let button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  alert('The button was clicked');
});
```

`addEventListener` is different from other functions we've seen so far. Let's look at it.

It takes in two arguments. The first (`'click'`) is a string event name. This is the kind of event
to listen for.

The second argument is a _callback_. It's a function with the code to run when button is clicked.

<Info>

There are a lot of events you can listen for. MDN has an
[Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) that lists most of them.
We'll stick to `'click'` for now, but you'll see other common events in future examples.

</Info>

### Callbacks

Let's look again at the function in the `addEventListener` example:

```
  function () {
    alert('The button was clicked');
  }
```

Nothing special about this function makes it a callback. It's a callback because we pass it to
another function to call later.

It's still a function. We can put whatever code we want inside. That's the code that runs later - it
gets 'called back', hence the name _callback_.

There are lots of functions in JavaScript like `addEventListener` that run some code later on.
Often, those functions will use callbacks: they'll take in a function as an argument, and run that
code later.

### setTimeout

If you want to run some code later, `setTimeout` lets you do that. You pass it a function to run
later and a number of milliseconds to wait.

<JsDemo defer>

```js
setTimeout(function () {
  alert('This happens after waiting 2 seconds');
}, 2000);
```

</JsDemo>

A millisecond is 1/1000 seconds, so waiting 2000ms is the same as waiting 1 second.

The first argument to `setTimeout` is a _callback_. It's a function to run after waiting.

### setInterval

`setInterval` is like `setTimeout`, except it runs the function again and again after each interval.

<JsDemo defer>

```js
setInterval(function () {
  console.log('This message will be logged every 4 seconds');
}, 4000);
```

</JsDemo>

Every 4 seconds (4000ms), the callback function will run.

<Info>

_Stopping a timeout or interval_

You might want to cancel a timeout or interval you've set. You can use the `clearTimeout` or
`clearInterval` function to clear a timeout or interval you've set. To use it, you have to know
which interval or timeout you're removing.

When you call `setTimeout` or `setInterval`, the function returns an id number. Pass that id number
to `clearTimeout` or `clearInterval` to clear that timeout or interval.

Here's an example with `setTimeout`:

```
let timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This won't get logged, because the timeout will get cleared first");
}, 3000);
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```

`clearInterval` works similarly.

</Info>

## Arrays

A variable can only hold one piece of data. Objects are a tool to combine objects into a bigger
piece of data. Each object property has a name and a value.

Arrays are a kind of Object that acts as a list.

```js
let groceryList = ['crunchy carrot', 'tasty tangerine', 'sweet strawberry'];
```

`groceryList` is an array of strings. The variable still holds one value, the array. The _array_
holds three items.

To create an array, you use the square brackets `[]`, with the items inside, separated by commas.

### Accessing array items

To get an item from an array, you use square brackets and an _index_: the position of the item you
want.

```js
groceryList[1]; // 'tasty tangerine'
```

Huh. That's the second item in the list.

In JavaScript, array indexes start from 0. It's like we're counting how many items to skip before
the item we want. The first item in an array has zero items to skip before it, so we access it like:

```js
groceryList[0]; // 'crunchy carrot'
```

No items to skip over, so the index is 0.

Zero-indexed arrays are common to lots of programming languages. There's a lot of programmer memes
about "programmers start counting at zero". Now you can understand those memes too!

### Length

Arrays have a `length` property that gives the number of items.

```js
let groceryList = ['crunchy carrot', 'tasty tangerine', 'sweet strawberry'];
groceryList.length; // 3
```

It's a property on the array object.

### Array methods

There's a lot of useful built-in functions for working with arrays.

To add an item to the end of an array, you can use `push`

```js
groceryList.push('perfect peach');
console.log(groceryList); // ['crunchy carrot', 'tasty tangerine', 'sweet strawberry', 'perfect peach']
```

You get the `push` function by accessing it on the array with a `.`, so `groceryList.push`.

Functions that are attached to objects this way are called "methods". You can see a list of all the
[Array methods on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods).

Working with arrays is really common in programming, so you'll get lots of practice with it.

## Loops

If you want to do something lots of times, you need some kind of loop. JavaScript has lots of kinds
of loops, but we're just going to focus on three kinds for now.

<Info>

Computers are really fast. Lots of the cool things we can do with computers come from doing simple
things a huge number of times.

How fast are we talking?

Well, a modern processor usually has a _clock speed_ between 2 and 3 GHz. GHz is giga hertz, a unit
that means "billion things per second". So, a processor can do 2 or 3 billion things per second. The
_things_ are really basic - like "add two numbers together". But, if you can turn those numbers into
images, music, pages, and buttons, 2 billion per second can do a lot!

Using this extraordinary speed directly usually means using loops.

### forEach: Loop through the items in an array

To do something for each item in an array, use `forEach`.

```
let groceryList = ['crunchy carrot', 'tasty tangerine', 'sweet strawberry'];
groceryList.forEach(function (item) {
  console.log("Buying the " + item);
});
// Logs:
// Buying the crunchy carrot
// Buying the tasty tangerine
// Buying the sweet strawberry
```

`forEach` is a method on an array, (like `push`), and it takes a callback function to run on each of
the items. It runs the function once for every item in the list, passing in each item as the first
argument.

#### `forEach` and `querySelectorAll`

A useful pattern for small websites is to combine `forEach` with `querySelectorAll` to do something
for all the elements that match a particular selector.

This (somewhat silly) snippet finds all the list items, logs their `innerText`, and removes them.
That's probably not that useful, but the pattern "find all the matching elements and do something
with each one" is handy.

```js
let listItems = document.querySelectorAll('li');
allTheListItems.forEach(function (item) {
  console.log(item.innerText);
  item.remove();
});
```

### while

If you want to run some code a bunch of times and an array isn't involved, one fundamental looping
tool is the `while` loop.

```js
let response = '';
while (response !== 'quit') {
  response = prompt("Type 'quit' to exit the loop");
}
```

The syntax is like an `if` statement.

```
while (condition) {
  code to run for as long as the condition is true
}
```

The condition will get checked before the loop starts. If it's `true`, then the code in the loop
will run. Then the condition will be checked again. If it's still `true`, then the code will run
again. This process will repeat again and again until the condition is `false`.

Here's an example where the loop multiplies all the numbers from 1 to 20:

```js
let number = 1;
let total = 1;
while (number <= 20) {
  total = total * number;
  number = number + 1;
}
console.log('number: ' + number);
console.log('total: ' + total);
```

If you run this, the console shows:

```
number: 21
total: 2432902008176640000
```

That's more than I'd want to calculate by hand.

<Prompt>

Why is `number` 21, if the condition in the while loop is `number <= 20`

</Prompt>
<Answer>

Each time the loop body executes, number goes up by one. On the last time through the loop body,
number is 20. We could pretend that the code turns into:

```
  total = total * 20;
  number = 20 + 1;
```

After those lines execute, number is 21. Then, the while loop condition is checked one more time:

```
21 <= 20 // false
```

Since it's false, the while loop stops.

**Infinite Loops**

If the condition is never `false`, the loop will keep going indefinitely. Sometimes, that's an
accident, and you'll need to stop the program and change the code before you run it again. Other
times, an infinite loop is actually what you want! For instance, in a game, you might have a loop
that updates the screen, for as long as the game is running.

</Info>

### for

In the multiply-all-the-numbers example above, code before the loop, in the condition, and inside
the loop body that determined how long the loop ran:

- The starting value of the `number` variable was set before the loop started
- The condition to check was in the parentheses
- The `number` variable was updated in the loop body

These three parts are really common in a lot of looping situations. Where does the loop start? Where
does the loop end? How does it get updated each time?

In a `for` loop, all three of those pieces go in the parentheses. Here's the same multiplication
example, but using a `for` loop:

```js
let total = 1;
for (let number = 1; number <= 20; number = number + 1) {
  total = total * number;
}
console.log('number: ' + number); // number: 21
console.log('total: ' + total); // total: 2432902008176640000
```

Some programmers like this syntax better, because it has all the code about where the loop stops and
starts in one place. It's also fewer lines than the other example, and it's how some other popular
languages express looping.

For most problems, using whichever kind of loop you want to use is okay. Almost any loop can do what
the other loops can do.

### Aside: Semicolons

`;` is a semicolon. Some of the examples had semicolons at the end of the line, some did not.

Js uses semicolons to end a statement.

```js
var x = 10;
```

The `;` means the statement is done.

Since people sometimes forget the semicolons, JavaScript will automatically add them at the end of
each line when it runs the code.

So, this is allowed:

```
var x = 10
alert(x * 10)
```

and when it runs, it turns into

```js
var x = 10;
alert(x * 10);
```

Some people like to write code without semicolons, some people like to write code with semicolons.

There's a couple situations where there's a difference, but usually you can choose whichever style
you like best.

### Potential Misconception: If vs. When

When we talk informally, sometimes we say things like "if the button is clicked, show the message".
That can lead to a misconception about how JavaScript's `if` works.

`if` is for checking whether something is true _right now_.

```js
if (age < 18) {
  alert('cannot buy movie ticket');
}
```

The code will not run again on its own if `age` changes.

To take some action when something happens, we use `addEventListener` to set up our response to the
_event_. Run this code _when_ the event happens.

## Things we have not covered

As you can tell, JavaScript has a lot more moving parts than HTML or CSS. This intro has covered a
lot, but it has left out even more.

We've covered enough of the basics of the language that you can try things out, build something
interesting, run into some issues and roadblocks, and find out more.

<Info>

Here's a partial list of JavaScript features that we haven't covered here, but are probably worth
learning:

- regular expressions
- errors, throw, try, catch, finally
- for in, for of
- switch, break, and continue
- special characters and escaping
- template literals
- hoisting
- execution context, scope, and globals
- new, class, inheritance, prototypes
- this
- get and set
- arrow functions
- destructuring assignment
- Promises, async
- fetch
- generators, yield
- Map, Set
- Date, JSON
- libraries
