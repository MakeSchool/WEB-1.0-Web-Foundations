## More Exercises

It will take lots of exercises to get comfortable with JavaScript. As you work on your skills, you
should figure out what practice habits work well for you. Do you like to do a warm-up exercise in
the morning? Get in a practice session after lunch?

Whatever your practice habits are, you need a source of good practice problems to work on. This page
doesn't have 100 exercises.
