**HTML5** and **CSS3**

These brand names got lots of people excited about HTML and CSS around 2011. While HTML and CSS had
been around for a long time before that, giving them a version number with a popular logo drew
attention to features that were newly part of the standard.

The standards committee for HTML ([WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/)) that manages the HTML spec has made
HTML a _living standard_. That means that instead of numbered releases, instead we'll get steady
improvements and gradual changes.

Takeaways:

- There won't be an HTML6 or a CSS4.
- Saying "HTML5" is not a sign that the HTML is more advanced. It's all HTML.

### HTML Validation

## Accessibility

"Think about all the people who will use your site, and make it good for all of them"

Above all, if your site is broken, it's broken for everyone

- broken links
- unclear information
- bad structure

Other design considerations

- contrast
- use of color for semantic meanings
  - don't express something only in color - img alt - keyboard access, focus indicator
- link text
- font size, zoom, resizing
- page structure, headings
- semantic elements
- form labels

### Checking for Accessibility

Lighthouse

## Semantic elements

- blockquote
