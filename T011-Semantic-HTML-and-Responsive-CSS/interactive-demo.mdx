# CodePen-style Interactive Demo

In the Course Intro, we showed some interactive demos of what you could change with HTML, CSS, and
JS.

These kinds of interactive demos are really common in web development. Usually, it's so you can
experiment or share some snippet of code.

Some of the most popular ones are:

- Codepen
- CodeSandbox
- JsFiddle
- JSBin

## Reflection

Repl.it, which we've been using throughout the course, is an advanced tool of this kind. It actually
connects to a server to run the code, so works a little differently than the one we'll build.

There's tons of other tools that have at their core, an online code editor. Scrimba, Codeacademy,
Glitch, Github...
