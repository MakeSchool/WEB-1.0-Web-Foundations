# The Big Picture

We'll start from a simplified model of how the web works, and connect that to what you'll learn in
this course.

## The Web You Know

You are already familiar with the internet - you're using it right now!

You visit websites by tapping a link or searching something in the box at the top of the window,
then look at the content that's there. You can do all kinds of things - send messages, write posts,
shop, watch videos, or read tutorials.

So far, you've experienced the internet as a _user_. This course is about looking deeper at how some
of the core technologies come together to make those experiences work.

## One Step Deeper

Let's take our first look at how the web works.

[client and server as squares with an arrow connecting them]()

When you pull up a website, your computer or phone connects to another computer through a network.
It makes a request to that computer for some files - the website you want to see. The other computer
(called a server) sends back the files to your computer. Then, your computer shows you those files.

Front end development is about the files that get shown. Web programmers learn how to put the right
stuff in those files so that the users of the site see what the programmers want.

What's in those files? Primarily, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (though as we'll see, there's sometimes
more too). Your web browser - the program on your computer or phone that you use to view websites,
like Safari, Opera, Firefox, or Chrome - speaks HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When the browser sees files written in these web languages, it follows a known set of rules for
displaying the files as a website. Front end developers learn those rules, so that they can write
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the browser understands and displays the way they want.

Reality has a surprising amount of detail.

The web is much more complicated than this! It's more complicated than could be covered in a single
course, or than can fit in any one person's head! Hardware and software have to work together to
connect people with different devices to networks across the world.

## What this course covers

[client and server, with client circled for emphasis]()

This course will cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll learn some of the rules the
browser follows, and you'll practice using what you learn to make websites.

One issue: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are _big and complicated_. There's more than 100 HTML tags to
learn, with hundreds more attributes. There's a few hundred CSS properties and their possible
values. JavaScript is relatively smaller, keyword-wise - there's only 64 reserved words. But, as
you'll find when we start the JavaScript section, the language takes a lot more practice to learn to
use well.

In this course, we won't cover _everything_ about these languages. We're going to focus on what you
need to know to start building creative projects. We'll also focus on concepts that give you
_leverage_ - the skills and ideas that show up time and time again, and which make learning other
ideas easier.

### Which concepts will we focus on?

- HTML and CSS Syntax
- CSS Selectors
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Developer tools, skills, habits, and mindset

Why these?

**Syntax** means the rules of a language. In programming, those rules determine what code is valid.
Learning the syntax for HTML and CSS is the key for building websites, both in this course and in
the future. It will let you read code to understand how it works, write code of your own, and
recognize and fix errors. Many beginner errors are syntax errors. The syntax also gives you a
framework for learning and understanding more. Once you've learned how HTML tags work in general,
learning any individual tag will be easier.

This will also help with 'learning a syntax' in general. As you grow as a developer, you'll end up
learning lots of different syntaxes.

**CSS Selectors**, while somewhat arcane, give you a ton of power. They help you think about the
structure of your HTML. They let you target specific sets of elements with particular styles.
JavaScript also lets programmers use CSS selectors to find elements on the page for manipulation.

**JavaScript fundamentals** includes core programming concepts like variables, data types,
conditional statements, loops, and functions, as well as topics that are particular to web
development: selecting & modifying elements, responding to events, and sending requests to the
server. We're leaving a lot out - there's a lot more JavaScript to learn once you are comfortable
with these concepts. We're focused on these because they're common programming patterns that set you
up to learn other programming languages, and because with these skills in hand, you can build any
website (that doesn't do server stuff).

**Developer tools** power up your learning process, and they speed up your development workflow.
Professional developers use tools to understand, debug, and improve websites - or to see how another
developer built something.

## What this course doesn't cover

- Backend programming
- JavaScript frameworks
- Design

Remember, this course is only about this part of how the web works:

[client and server, with client circled for emphasis]()

We're not going to talk (much) about what happens on the server or in the network. We'll make sure
to cover enough so that you can publish your sites so other people can see. However, there's some
features that you won't be able to build until you've learned more about backend programming -
programming for the server.

In this course, we're also not going to cover everything about JavaScript - not even all of the core
language! JavaScript more than a language - it's also a huge ecosystem of libraries, tools, and
other people's code. We're not going to learn React, Vue, JQuery, or Angular, or any of the hundreds
of other JavaScript tools you might or might not have heard of. As a frontend developer, you may end
up learning these tools down the road. Using any of them effectively requires a foundation of the
basics, which is what we're practicing here.

Making great websites takes knowledge, skill, and practice. It also takes _taste_. What color to
use? How big should the button be? What should the title say? Where should the link go? These are
hard questions, and we're not going to focus on them in this course. We want you to explore your
creativity and build sites that are beautiful, funny, effective, fun, important, and useful - and
that lots of people use! But, we won't cover design in this course. We'll learn enough of the tools
underneath that you should be able to build what you (or someone else) can think of and draw out.

## Knowing About vs. Knowing How

There's so much out there to know about computers, and so many different things that programmers can
do with computers. It's worth calling out the difference between knowing _about_ something and
knowing how to use something. It's the difference between having heard of HTML and actually being
able to build a website.

For the core ideas of the course, we want you to have both: knowledge about what something is, and
the practical (and demonstrable) knowledge of how to use it.

For other topics, we're just giving you knowledge _about_ something. We want you to know that it
exists, but we're not going to have exercises and projects that help you apply that knowledge.
Sometimes these are related topics that offer historical context. A lot of these will just be
pointers to huge topics, that might take a whole course to cover on their own (some of those courses
are coming soon!) We think they're important, but also that you have to learn things piece by piece.
That means this course can't cover them in depth - just indicate that they exist.

## The Path to Expertise

Progression in learning to code tends to follow these steps:

1. Reading code
2. Making small changes to someone else's code
3. Writing code to solve a predefined problem
4. Independent, creative coding

We want you to become an expert. Making things with code is fun and satisfying, especially when you
take a project all the way from an idea to an app you can share with the world. To get there, you'll
need to move through these stages. Learners usually cycle through these stages for each new concept,
with an overall progression forward. It'll take time and effort!

Let's talk more about what to expect from these stages, and how to tell that you're making progress.

1. Reading Code

At this stage, you'll be able to read code and recognize the different parts that make it up. You'll
be able to name the different pieces of syntax, and identify what they do. Progress in this stage
often looks like being better able to predict what some code will do, and increasing feelings of
comfort when looking at a piece of code.

2. Editing someone else's code

The next level is being able to make tweaks to code, in order to achieve the change you want to see
in the output. You learn to find and fix basic errors. For many developers, this stage involves a
lot of copy/paste style development. Borrowing code to get something done is common, and encouraged!
But, it's not the level of mastery that we're aiming for.

3. Writing code to solve a defined problem

After editing code comes writing code from scratch. First, new coders learn to solve narrow,
pre-defined problems. Having a smaller scope means less complexity to manage, which helps get more
practice, instead of spending time stuck on things that are too hard or complicated. Problem solving
skills take lots of practice, so challenges at this level gradually increase in scope and
difficulty.

4. Building independently

Eventually, learners get comfortable taking an idea, breaking it down into component pieces, and
building the whole whole thing "from scratch" - that is, without relying on steps they follow from a
tutorial. Often, programmers will still draw from reference materials, whether that's documentation
or example code. They know what's possible given their set of skills, and they know the boundaries
of their abilities.

When you get to this level, you're able to improvise, figuring out on the fly how to solve
subproblems that you encounter. With the confidence that you can solve problems as they arise, you
can explore creatively.

## Questions, Examples, Exercises, and Projects

To support your progress through these stages, we'll give you different kinds of practice materials.

_Questions_ like flashcards, multiple choice, and text response will help you learn and remember the
concepts.

_Examples_ will give you a chance to explore code without a specific goal, except to see for
yourself how something works.

_Exercises_ have a specific goal that you'll need to achieve with code. Sometimes they're tricky,
but you'll have the tools you need to solve them.

_Projects_ will tap into your creativity. Since they're more open-ended, they take longer, and it
won't always be perfectly clear when you're done. We'll give you the criteria that you _must_ hit,
but how you get there is up to you.

## What you'll build

Here are the projects that you'll build in this course. For each one, we'll give you a checklist for
what you should do, and an example of what a completed version of the project might look like.

- HTML Recipes

You'll use HTML to structure a recipe page so that it looks tasty instead of messy.

- CSS Mission Statement

You'll use HTML and CSS to build a styled mission statement page.

- CSS Box Model News Article

Use CSS to style a page to look like a news article.

- Multi-page mini-pedia

Build a multi-page site styled like a mini version of a wiki.

- JS Buzzfeed-style quiz page

Use JavaScript to build a buzzfeed-style quiz page, with interactive questions.

- "Hard mode" Pinterest

Use CSS and JavaScript to build a page that feels like Pinterest (with only some of the features)

- Live flight tracker site

Use JavaScript to fetch flight info from OpenSky and display airport arrivals and departures.

- Viral site

Use all the skills you've learned in the course (plus a few new ones) to build a shareable,
meme-worthy website.

## "Mise en place" creative projects

_Mise en place_ is French for "everything in its place". The phrase is used in cooking to
distinguish prep work - gathering the ingredients, organizing the kitchen, chopping vegetables -
from the cooking.

For projects that allow creative freedom, we've seen that students get stuck in organizing their own
work. We're going to help you organize how you do your projects by providing a pre-project _Mise en
place_ checklist, so that you have all the 'ingredients' for your project before you start coding.

## Who is this course for?

This course doesn't have any formal prerequisites, but that doesn't mean it's for everyone.

The course materials are in English, and expect a familiarity with computers and the Internet. You
don't need to be a super-fast keyboardist, but you should be able to touch-type, so that typing
doesn't slow you down when you're working on the assignments.

You might not need this course if...

- You only want to know _about_ HTML, CSS, and JS, but you don't want to know how to use them to
  build websites
- You want to build a specific website right now. Instead, use a site builder like Squarespace, Wix,
  or Webflow.
- You want to build a blog, or write content online. Use a tool like Wordpress, Ghost, or Medium
  instead.
- You already know HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you've already built projects like the ones in this
  course, you might want a more advanced course. (Though, feel free to use this material as a
  reference or a refresher).

This course is for the full picture:

- theoretical underpinning: what's happening under the hood
- practical application: exercises, hands-on projects
- problem solving: debugging, recognizing and solving errors
- creative projects: building projects of your own design (while having guidelines and guardrails to
  keep you on track)

- context: where does this knowledge fit into the bigger picture of CS, and your journey?
- community: sharing journey with others, making friends, having mentors
- credit and recognition: college credit, social and professional recognition of your skill

## How is the course organized?

If you look at the navigation sidebar, you'll see that the course is split into 10 different
_topics_. Each topic covers introduces new material, lets you practice, and has an opportunity to
build something.

Each topic in the course builds on the others. The course assumes that you'll move through the
topics one after the other. But, if you already know some of the early material, or you're curious
about what's at the end, you can browse ahead too.
