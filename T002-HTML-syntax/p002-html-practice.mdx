# HTML Practice

Getting good at structuring HTML documents takes lots of practice. Complete these challenges to work
on structuring documents.

## Instructions

In each challenge, there's a file with lots of text. Add the appropriate HTML tags around the text,
so that the document is structured correctly. For each one, there's an example image of what the
completed site should look like.

If you get stuck, you can ask in Discord, or check the solution for the exercise.

### About Repl.it

We want you to learn coding - not get stuck setting up your computer.

Repl.it is an in-browser code editor. It lets you write code without installing or setting up
anything on your computer. It also lets you publish and share your projects with your friends. We'll
also use Repl.its other features, like working together on projects and getting feedback on your
code.

If you have any questions about how to use Repl.it, you can ask in Discord or check the
[Repl.it Documentation](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/00-overview). You probably only need the
first couple of pages, but feel free to read the whole thing if you're curious!

## Exercises

### Change the tags to make the page look like the image

For these exercises, change the tags so that the result looks like the image. These aren't supposed
to be super hard. They're to get you used to editing HTML.
