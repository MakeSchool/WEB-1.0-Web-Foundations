# Project: Recipe Page

## Goal

You're building an HTML recipe page like the [demo](https://Recipe-Page-Demo.makeschool2.repl.co).
It should include:

- a header (any of `h1` through `h6`)
- two lists: an unordered list `ul` of ingredients, and an ordered list `ol` of steps
- a paragraph for the description
- an image
- a link

If you want, you can organize the elements on the page in a different order than the example. Feel
free to add more elements to your page if you'd like - pictures, descriptions, tips, links.

## Steps

- Gather the ingredients you'll need (Mise-en-place)
- Add elements to your page, one by one. Each time you make a change, check the result by pressing
  the green "play" button.
- Add all the required elements to your recipe page
- When you're done, submit through Repl.it and share your finished site in Discord and with your
  friends!

## Mise-en-place

Before you get started, you need to have your "ingredients" prepped and your tools organized.

What you'll need before you start coding:

First, you'll need to **Choose a recipe**.

Then, identify the parts of the recipe you'll use:

- name
- description
- image
- list of ingredients
- list of steps
- link to source of recipe

If it's helpful, copy those parts of the recipe into a separate document to work from.

## Start your project

Here's the starter code for you to fork:

### About Repl.it

We want you to learn coding - not get stuck setting up your computer.

Repl.it is an in-browser code editor. It lets you write code without installing or setting up
anything on your computer. It also lets you publish and share your projects with your friends. We'll
also use Repl.its other features, like working together on projects and getting feedback on your
code.

If you have any questions about how to use Repl.it, you can ask in Discord or check the
[Repl.it Documentation](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/00-overview). You probably only need the
first couple of pages, but feel free to read the whole thing if you're curious!

## How to get unstuck

It's easy to get stuck - especially if this is your first time making a site in HTML.

If you are stuck, you can

- Look back at the examples from the previous page
- Ask for help in Discord
- Check out the tips, tools, and strategies on the next page
