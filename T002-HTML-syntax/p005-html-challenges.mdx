# HTML Practice

Getting good at structuring HTML documents takes lots of practice.

Complete these challenges to work on structuring documents.

## Instructions

In each challenge, there's a file with lots of text. Add the appropriate HTML tags around the text,
so that the document is structured correctly. For each one, there's an example image of what the
completed site should look like.

If you get stuck, you can ask in Discord, or check the solution for the exercise.
