# Tips, Tools, and Strategies

## Common Errors

When you're first learning the syntax, there's a bunch of common errors.

- typo for the name of an element
- forgetting or using the wrong symbol in the wrong spot (typos for the HTML syntax)
  - forgetting quotes around attributes
  - wrong direction of the slash for a closing tag
- forgetting a closing tag
- improper nesting of tags (crossing the tags)

(Fix the error game)

### Tips and Strategies

Formatting is your friend. The browser ignores whitespace like spaces, tabs, and newlines. It also
ignores comments.

It's _much_ easier to spot mistakes if your HTML is formatted nicely. "Nicely" means that (for the
most part) each new tag goes on a new line, indented further than its parent element. The closing
tag is dedented, so the nested structure is visible.

Comments are also super helpful. They have a funky syntax, so it's easy to mess them up too.

- Highlight and use [ctrl /] to comment out a section
- Use comments to name sections of your page

Debugging HTML using comments.

- comment out the code you think is broken
- comment it back in, piece by piece, to identify what's broken

## Developer Tool: Browser Inspector

Desktop browsers have a tool called the inspector or dev console that lets you see the code for a
page.

### Try it now

- Somewhere on the page, secondary click (right click, two-finger click, or hold control and click)
  to open the context menu
- Click to open the inspector: "Inspect" in Chrome, or "Inspect Element" in Firefox or Safari.
- See that the Inspector opens in a tray at the bottom or side of your screen:

- The panel shows the HTML for all of the elements on the page
- The highlighted element is the one that you clicked on
- As you hover over other elements in the panel, you can see that the browser highlights the
  corresponding elements on the page
