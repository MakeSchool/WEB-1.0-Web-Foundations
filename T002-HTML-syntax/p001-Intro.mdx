# What is HTML?

In the course intro, we learned that:

- **HTML** is for the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS** is for styling the page.
- **JavaScript** is for controlling interactions.

HTML is a syntax for the structure and content of pages. It's made of letters and symbols that
follow some rules.

Let's see the example of what you'll build, then dig into the syntax.

## An HTML Recipe Site

Here's a preview of the type of site you'll build first.

<Exercise title="Recipe Page Demo" contentSrc="@makeschool2/Recipe-Page-Demo" outputOnly={true} />

It doesn't look incredible, but it gets the job done. When we learn CSS, we can improve how it
looks. By the end of this topic, you'll be able to write code for this kind of site from scratch.

## HTML Tags

<HtmlDemo srcString="<p>This tender treat is a perfect use for any old bananas you have sitting on the counter.</p>" />

The HTML turns into a paragraph of text. This an HTML **element**: a single building block of a
webpage. Let's break down the parts of the syntax.

`<p>` is an HTML **tag**. It starts an element, and says what kind of element it is - in this case,
`p` is for a _paragraph_ element.

`</p>` is a **closing tag**. It says "the paragraph ends here". Notice that it has a forward slash
`/`. Everything between the opening tag and closing tag are inside of the element.

Each **opening tag** needs to have a matching closing tag. Every `<p>` needs a `</p>`.

In between the opening and closing tags is some text:
`This tender treat is a perfect use for any old bananas you have sitting on the counter.` It's what
actually shows up on the page.

Let's learn about these elements.

`h1` is a _heading level one_ tag. It means the has the effect of making the text big. `h1` is the
biggest size heading, usually used for the title of the page. There's 6 levels of heading, with 6
tags, representing a smaller heading as the number goes up: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`.

`ul` stands for _unordered list_. It makes a list. The list items inside each get a dot next to
them.

`li` is a _list item_. These are the elements in the list. Since they're between the opening and
closing tags the `ul` element, they appear inside the same list.

`img` is an _image_. It has a new syntax too: an attribute `src` for the source of the image. That
`src` is the location where the browser can find the image itself.

## More HTML Elements

Here's another demo, with four new html elements.

<HtmlDemo
  srcString='
<h1>Easy Chocolate Chip Banana Bread</h1>
<ul>
  <li>10 minutes prep time</li>
  <li>50 minutes bake time</li>
  <li>1 hr total</li>
  <li>Makes 6 servings</li>
</ul>
<img src="./banana-bread.jpeg" />'
/>

<TextResponse>
<Prompt>

What are the four new HTML elements you see in this example?

<Explanation>

The four elements are:

- `h1`
- `ul`
- `li`
- `img`

  - h1-h6
  - p
  - ul, ol, li
  - img

## Common Errors

When you're first learning the syntax, there's a bunch of common errors.

- typo for the name of an element
- forgetting or using the wrong symbol in the wrong spot (typos for the HTML syntax)
  - forgetting quotes around attributes
  - wrong direction of the slash for a closing tag
- forgetting a closing tag
- improper nesting of tags (crossing the tags)

### Tips and Strategies

Formatting is your friend. The browser ignores whitespace like spaces, tabs, and newlines. It also
ignores comments.

It's _much_ easier to spot mistakes if your HTML is formatted nicely. "Nicely" means that (for the
most part) each new tag goes on a new line, indented further than its parent element. The closing
tag is dedented, so the nested structure is visible.

Comments are also super helpful. They have a funky syntax, so it's easy to mess them up too.

- Highlight and use [ctrl /] to comment out a section
- Use comments to name sections of your page

Debugging HTML using comments.

- comment out the code you think is broken
- comment it back in, piece by piece, to identify what's broken

## Developer Tool: Browser Inspector

Desktop browsers have a tool called the inspector or dev console that lets you see the code for a
page.

### Try it now

- Somewhere on the page, secondary click (right click, two-finger click, or hold control and click)
  to open the context menu
- Click to open the inspector: "Inspect" in Chrome, or "Inspect Element" in Firefox or Safari.
- See that the Inspector opens in a tray at the bottom or side of your screen:

- The panel shows the HTML for all of the elements on the page
- The highlighted element is the one that you clicked on
- As you hover over other elements in the panel, you can see that the browser highlights the
  corresponding elements on the page

## Project: Recipe Page

- Change the recipe site to use the correct elements
- Turn this recipe blob into a website that looks like (this)
