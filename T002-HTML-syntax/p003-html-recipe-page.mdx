# Project: HTML Recipe Page

## Goal

You're building an HTML recipe page like the [demo](https://Recipe-Page-Demo.makeschool2.repl.co).
It should include:

- a header (any of `h1` through `h6`)
- two lists: an unordered list `ul` of ingredients, and an ordered list `ol` of steps
- a paragraph for the description
- an image
- a link

If you want, you can organize the elements on the page in a different order than the example. Feel
free to add more elements to your page if you'd like - pictures, descriptions, tips, links.

## Steps

- Gather the ingredients you'll need (Mise-en-place)
- Add elements to your page, one by one. Each time you make a change, check the result by pressing
  the green "play" button.
- Add all the required elements to your recipe page
- When you're done, submit through Repl.it and share your finished site in Discord and with your
  friends!

## Mise en place

Before you get started, you need to have your "ingredients" prepped and your tools organized.

What you'll need before you start coding:

First, you'll need to **Choose a recipe**.

Then, identify the parts of the recipe you'll use:

- name
- description
- image
- list of ingredients
- list of steps
- link to source of recipe

If it's helpful, copy those parts of the recipe into a separate document to work from.

## Start your project

Here's the starter code for you to fork:

## How to get unstuck

It's easy to get stuck, especially if this is your first time making a site in HTML.

If you are stuck:

- Look back at the examples from the previous page
- Ask for help in Discord
- Check out the tips, tools, and strategies on the next page
