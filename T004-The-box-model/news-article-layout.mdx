# News Article Layout

You've seen articles on the internet. They're a _super_ popular format for a webpage.

In this project, you'll lay out a page to look like an online article.

## Goal

Here's a demo of a [completed version of the project](https://ArticlePageDemo.makeschool2.repl.co),
and here's a
[pinterest board of different article page layouts](https://www.pinterest.com/spasenoski/article-page/).
Your article doesn't have to look exactly like this, but it should have a header, a footer, and a
column of content.

## Mise-en-place

Before you get started coding, you need to organize your ingredients.

- Written Content
- Images or Logos
- Links
- A sketch of your layout
- Colors and fonts

This project is all about an article, so the first thing you'll need is a piece of writing. If
you've got a blog post or essay you've written, feel free to use that.

It's important to be excited about the article you're styling, but try not to spend too long
deciding on content.

If you don't have a piece of your own writing handy, there's a lot of content that's available under
a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). That means you can remix it for
free, so long as you link back to where you got it. All of Wikipedia is Creative Commons licensed,
and there's a nice Wikipedia page
[List of major Creative Commons licensed works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_Creative_Commons_licensed_works)
with lots of options for content to practice with.

After picking the article content, collect any images, logos, and links you want to use.

If there's no real sites you want to link to, you can use `"#"` as the `href` value. `#` will link
to the current page.

Think through your layout. It may be helpful to sketch it out on paper ahead of time. We're aiming
for a one-column layout, with a header, the article content, and a footer. If you want an added
challenge, you can add more sections to your layout, or try a two-column or three-column layout.

Pick a color palette and a set of fonts. You can use a tool like [colormind](http://colormind.io/)
or [coloors](https://coolors.co/) to pick colors.

## Instructions

Once you've organized the ingredients for your article page, fork the demo repl.it and get started.

Add your content to the page, and structure it with HTML.

Using your new knowledge of the Box Model, style the page to look like an article.

## Challenges

After you've done the basic styling of your article page, feel free to add more design elements.
Here's some ideas:

- inset images, with captions
- hero image, with overlay text
- drop caps for the first character of a section
- If you have a longer article, add a table of contents, with in-page links
