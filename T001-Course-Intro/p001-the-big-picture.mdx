# The Big Picture

We'll start from a simplified model of how the web works, and connect that to what you'll learn in
this course.

## The Web You Know

You are already familiar with the internet - you're using it right now!

You visit websites by tapping a link or searching something in the box at the top of the window,
then look at the content that's there. You can do all kinds of things - send messages, write posts,
shop, watch videos, or read tutorials.

So far, you've experienced the internet as a _user_. This course is about looking deeper at how some
of the core technologies come together to make those experiences work.

## One Step Deeper

Let's take our first look at how the web works.

When you pull up a website, your computer or phone connects to another computer through a network.
It makes a request to that computer for some files - the website you want to see. The other computer
(called a server) sends back the files to your computer. Then, your computer shows you those files.

Front end development is about the files that get shown. Web programmers learn how to put the right
stuff in those files so that the users of the site see what the programmers want.

What's in those files? Primarily, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (though as we'll see, there's sometimes
more too). Your web browser - the program on your computer or phone that you use to view websites,
like Safari, Opera, Firefox, or Chrome - speaks HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When the browser sees files written in these web languages, it follows a known set of rules for
displaying the files as a website. Front end developers learn those rules, so that they can write
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the browser understands and displays the way they want.

Reality has a surprising amount of detail.

The web is much more complicated than this! It's more complicated than could be covered in a single
course, or than can fit in any one person's head! Hardware and software have to work together to
connect people with different devices to networks across the world.
