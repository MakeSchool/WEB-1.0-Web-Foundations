# Who Is This Course For

This course is for the full picture:

- theoretical underpinning: what's happening under the hood
- practical application: exercises, hands-on projects
- problem solving: debugging, recognizing and solving errors
- creative projects: building projects of your own design (while having guidelines and guardrails to
  keep you on track)

- context: where does this knowledge fit into the bigger picture of CS, and your journey?
- community: sharing journey with others, making friends, having mentors
- credit and recognition: college credit, social and professional recognition of your skill

## Background Knowledge

This course doesn't have any formal prerequisites, so you don't need any other courses before you
start this one.

- **Reading English** The course materials are in English. To complete the course, you'll need to be
  able to read English.
- **Internet Access** You don't need to have a super fast internet connection to complete the
  course, but the materials and assignments are online, so the course will depend internet
  connection.
- **Typing** You don't need to be a super-fast typer, but you should be able to touch-type, so that
  typing doesn't slow you down when you're working on the assignments.

The course also assumes a familiarity with computers and the Internet. You don't need to know how
computers or the web works in detail, but when you build websites for the course projects, the
course assumes you've spent some time browsing the web and using computers.

## Who this course isn't for

You might not need this course if...

- You only want to know _about_ HTML, CSS, and JS, but you don't want to know how to use them to
  build websites
- You want to build a specific website right now. (Instead, use a site builder like Squarespace,
  Wix, or Webflow.)
- You want to build a blog, or write content online. (Use a tool like Wordpress, Ghost, or Medium
  instead.)
- You already know HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you've already built projects like the ones in this
  course, you might want a more advanced course. (Though, feel free to use this material as a
  reference or a refresher).
