# Buzzfeed-style Quiz

Create a custom quiz, showing different answers based on what the user answers.

Were you ever a fan of those Buzzfeed-style quizzes, like
[Which Harry Potter Character Are You](https://web.archive.org/web/20210406175916/https://www.buzzfeed.com/marietelling/which-harry-potter-character-are-you)?

Whether you like them or not, they are a staple of online culture. Here's how they work:

1. There's a list of multiple choice questions
2. The user chooses a response to each question
3. When all the questions are answered, the quiz shows the result.

The questions and options and the possible results are typically drawn from pop culture, often of
the same theme.

Let's build one.

## Mise en place

Before you get started, here's what you'll need. Type these up in a doc or a text file, so that you
are ready to copy and paste them into your code when the time comes.

- Title and subtitle for your quiz
- Your list of questions and the choices for each prompt
- A list of the possible results from the quiz
- Any images you plan to use for your quiz

The Harry Potter quiz above had 12 questions, each with 9 options. Don't feel like you have to come
up with that many if you don't want. Three or four questions with three or four options is fine.
